Because the tribe had no authorization to use the Dodge Flat groundwater, its use did not have priority over the company's rights. The change use application did not threaten to prove detrimental to the public interest. The company was only permitted to pump water up to the amount of the unappropriated perennial yield. The State Engineer imposed this limitation in part to protect the Truckee River water quality and native fish habitats.

The argument that vested water rights could be lost by applying for and receiving a permit modifying the use of those rights failed as nothing in Nev. Rev.

Thus, the cancellation and later reinstatement of the city's permit did not affect its underlying vested rights.

The grazers filed suit and sought to enjoin the director of grazing and the Secretary from enforcing the rules because the grazers believed the fees were unreasonable. The district court denied the demurrer of the director of grazing and entered a default judgment for the grazers when the director of grazing refused to replead. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the Secretary was not an indispensable party to the case; and (2) the grazing fees, although uniform throughout the United States, were not reasonable and other factors should have been taken into consideration.",livestock;grazing land;public use;renewal,"Washoe County, NV",39.9735522,-119.4871139,60 Nev. 219,,Case Law,application/pdf,,,

Appellant filed a notice of exceptions to the determination of the state engineer. The matter was heard and submitted to the trial court for decision. The trial court filed findings and decisions in favor of respondents and denied appellant's motion for a new trial. Appellant contended that the right to the waters of the spring was lost by nonuse pursuant to Nev. Comp. Laws § 7897 (1929) and that the waters were subject to appropriation by him. Respondents argued that five years' nonuse as defined by § 7897 did no more than to shift the burden of proof as to abandonment and that abandonment, as opposed to forfeiture, had to obtain in order to cause the loss of a water right. The court agreed with the trial court that rights acquired before 1913 could only be lost in accordance with the law in existence at the time of enactment of the Water Law, namely, intentional abandonment. The trial court found that there was no abandonment of the waters of the spring by respondents' predecessors in interest, and there was substantial evidence in the record upon which to base such a finding.",abandonment;appropriation;irrigation;vested rights;beneficial use,"Nye County, NV",38.11862807,-116.4113373,60 Nev. 280,,Case Law,application/pdf,,,

As such, the tailings were preserved until it would be worthwhile for them to be sold. Thereafter, the subsequent locators moved the tailings elsewhere. The mill brought an action to quiet title. The trial court found in favor of the subsequent locators. The mill sought review. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that there was ample testimony to justify the trial court's conclusion that the land upon which the tailings pond was situated had become forfeited by the mill, was subject to re-entry, and was properly relocated by the subsequent locators. Thus, the subsequent locators had valid placer mining claims to the tailings. However, because there was no evidence that the mill intended to abandon the tailings, the court held that the mill had a superior claim to the tailings pond.

The successor brought an action against the insurer for the alleged loss in land value by reason of the corporation's water right. The lower court entered judgment for the corporation and insurer. The court affirmed the lower court's decision because the water right agreement was outside the chain of title; thus, the insurer had no duty to make good any damages to the successor. Further, the existence of a well and pipelines on the successor's property provided the successor with constructive notice of the agreement.

The cancellation of the first permit did not violate the landowner's due process rights because she was aware of the permit's conditions when it was granted. However, the trial court should have used its equitable power to grant relief to the landowner because the Administrative Procedures Act, Nev. Rev.

The evidence showed that plaintiff and his predecessors in interest had cultivated the 80 acres of land enclosed by a fence for more than five years prior to the institution of the suit. The court found that plaintiff had established a superior title by adverse possession to those 80 acres under Nev. Rev. Laws § 4957.

On appeal, the court determined that the record showed that the landowner refused to sign the agreement of sale or the deed until a provision objectionable to him, which tended to include other lands not described in the subdivisions, was struck from the instruments. This was sufficient to charge the attorney for the property claimant, who was representing his client in the matter, with knowledge of the existence of other lands under the control of the landowner.

The individual subsequently filed a complaint under the same docket number as the petition again requesting water rights from the city and adding a claim for damages. The trial court dismissed the construction company for failure to state a claim, denied the individual's motion to amend the pleadings nunc pro tunc, and ordered that all documents filed in the case be stricken as fugitive documents. The court affirmed the dismissal of the construction company, holding that the allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action against it. The court reversed the order striking the documents.

The purchaser later discovered that the amount of actually owed was less than that set forth in the judgment. The seller refused to agree to modification of the judgment.

The State Board of Agriculture and other parties sought judicial review of the ruling. The trial court upheld the approval of an application to appropriate water for public recreation and fishery purposes, but reversed the approval of the applications to appropriate water for stockwatering and wildlife watering purposes. Both parties appealed the order and the court affirmed the part of the trial court's order that upheld the state engineer's decision, but reinstated the remaining portions of the engineer's decision. The court concluded that no absolute diversion requirement precluded the grant of an in situ water right to the lake's water. The court saw no threat to the public interest in the grant to a public agency of a water right to the lake for public recreation purposes.

The court held that the addendum attached to the option contracts rendered them unenforceable because they were not supported by mutuality of obligation or consideration. Although the purchaser tendered the purchase price of the option contracts to a third party, release of the funds was contingent upon satisfaction of the items of the addendum. The court rejected the purchaser's claim that the options were non-severable from the overall agreement to purchase the land. The court noted that the land purchase had been completed while exercise of the options could have been delayed pursuant to their terms.

Because the grantor's intent dedicate the water rights to public use was not clear until a certain date, the utility contended that its water rights should have been ""valued"" according to its cost of reproduction or replacement as of that date. Upon appeal, the court stated that commission was given no means by which to determine the costs of the utility's water rights at anything other than the figure given to it that was for the original cost. Thus, the court held that there was no error in the commission's decision, and as the utility received a reasonable return on its investment based upon the commission's decision, the court affirmed the trial court that upheld that commission's opinion that the utility's rate was inflated according to its valuation of the utility's water rights based upon the ""original cost"" method of valuation.",public use;valuation,"Carson City, NV",39.16647354,-119.7653437,107 Nev. 951,,Case Law,application/pdf,,,

The town petitioned for judicial review of this decision and the lower court found that Nev. Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed, and held that while the statute was constitutional, the town ""cured"" this forfeiture by resuming substantial use of the water rights. The statute was constitutional because the legislature had clearly intended to make the statute retroactive and applicable to vested groundwater rights and was a permissible exercise of police power. The town had cured its forfeiture, however, through use of the water rights after the statutory period of non-use. The court held that since the law disfavors a forfeiture, the state would bear the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, a statutory period of non-use, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion to determine whether the town ""cured"" the forfeiture by substantial use after the non-use period.",forfeited water rights;nonuse;abandonment;beneficial use;appropriation;acre feet;NRS 534.090,"Eureka County, NV",40.19443229,-116.376643,108 Nev. 163,,Case Law,application/pdf,,,

Thereafter, the sellers continued to pay all annual assessments on the water rights. A second purchaser acquired the property from the original purchaser's successors in interest. After they learned of the second purchaser's claims to water rights on the property, the sellers filed suit to quiet title to the water rights. The district court granted summary judgment for the second purchaser. On appeal, the court held that the agreement conveying the 67 acres reserved water rights to the sellers but was ambiguous as to which water rights were reserved. Therefore, parol evidence had to be considered to understand the agreement, and summary judgment was not appropriate.

No drawdown was permitted below the minimum pool level except as agreed. The owner opened the dam valve without the State's consent, releasing water below the minimum pool. The State argued that there was no provision in the agreement for the unilateral use of the minimum pool. The owner argued that his water rights were senior to the State's storage rights and therefore could have been satisfied by the minimum pool.

Appellants contended on appeal that they were entitled to separate compensation for their water rights and that there were issues of fact that precluded summary judgment. On appeal, the court ruled that appurtenant water rights were encompassed in the word ""interests"" and that the phrase ""all damage of every kind"" included the separate value of the water rights in the order. The court concluded that the water rights claims were barred by res judicata because the water rights were included in the final damages award paid to appellants, and the rights vested in respondent under the condemnation order of ""fee simple title to the real property"" to respondent.

The court held that the state engineer did not abuse its discretion because a mere uncorroborated statement of intent to put water to beneficial use, after nearly 20 years of nonuse, was insufficient to justify another proof of beneficial use extension. However, the court found it manifestly unfair to uphold the partial cancellation of the permittee's water rights because the permittee specifically proceeded to perfect its appropriation on the specific representation that if it failed, the cancelled water rights would revert to its irrigation certificate.
